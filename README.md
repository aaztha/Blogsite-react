# Blogsite-react
It is your typical blog site, made for learning component and other React stuff. The only cool thing about it is that it can scroll very smooooothly.
And yeah it is perfectly responsive. Probably my first pixel-perfect responsive site. 

Also, I haven't hosted it anywhere but I have added a video of this site for those who desperately wants to see this site without pulling and stuff.
